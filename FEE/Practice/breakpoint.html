1. The rows must be placed within a .container or .container-fluid for proper alignment and padding.
2. Use rows  to create a horizontal group of columns.
3. The content should be placed within columns and only columns maybe immediate children of rows.
4. Pre defined classes like .row and col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts.
5. Grid columns are created by specifying the no. of 12 available columns you wish to span.
